# Image-Embeddings-Integration-with-LayoutLM-and-Faster-R-CNN

## Description

This project demonstrates how to enhance LayoutLM by incorporating image embeddings generated by Faster R-CNN. The goal is to leverage both text and image information for improved document understanding and layout analysis.

## Overview

- **LayoutLM**: A pre-trained model designed for understanding the layout of documents and combining text and layout features.
- **Faster R-CNN**: A state-of-the-art object detection model used to extract features from images.

By integrating image embeddings from Faster R-CNN with LayoutLM, this project aims to improve document analysis tasks such as form understanding, document classification, and information extraction.

## Using Google Colab

### 1. Set Up Your Google Colab Environment

- Open Google Colab and create a new notebook.
- Install necessary libraries in a Colab cell:

    ```python
    !pip install transformers torch torchvision
    !pip install layoutlm
    !pip install detectron2
    ```

### 2. Prepare Your Dataset

- Upload your dataset to Colab using the file upload feature or Google Drive integration.

    ```python
    from google.colab import drive
    drive.mount('/content/drive')
    ```

- Place your images and text data in an accessible directory within Colab.

### 3. Generate Image Embeddings with Faster R-CNN

- Implement and run the Faster R-CNN model to extract image embeddings. Hereâ€™s a sample code snippet:

    ```python
    import torch
    from torchvision.models.detection import fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn
    from torchvision.transforms import functional as F
    from PIL import Image

    # Load Faster R-CNN model
    model = fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn(pretrained=True)
    model.eval()

    def get_image_embeddings(image_path):
        image = Image.open(image_path).convert("RGB")
        image_tensor = F.to_tensor(image).unsqueeze(0)
        with torch.no_grad():
            features = model(image_tensor)[0]
        return features

    embeddings = get_image_embeddings('/content/drive/MyDrive/your_image.jpg')
    ```

### 4. Integrate Image Embeddings with LayoutLM

- Implement the integration of image embeddings with LayoutLM:

    ```python
    from transformers import LayoutLMTokenizer, LayoutLMForTokenClassification

    tokenizer = LayoutLMTokenizer.from_pretrained("layoutlm-base-uncased")
    model = LayoutLMForTokenClassification.from_pretrained("layoutlm-base-uncased")

    def process_text_with_layoutlm(text, embeddings):
        # Tokenize and process text with LayoutLM
        tokens = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")
        # Combine tokens with embeddings
        # ...
        # Run LayoutLM model
        outputs = model(**tokens)
        return outputs

    result = process_text_with_layoutlm("Your document text here", embeddings)
    ```

### 5. Evaluate the Model

- Assess the performance of your integrated model:

    ```python
    def evaluate_model(outputs):
        # Evaluate the results
        # ...
        pass

    evaluate_model(result)
    ```

### 6. Save and Share Your Work

- Save your notebook and results:

    ```python
    from google.colab import files
    files.download('/path/to/your_results_file')
    ```
